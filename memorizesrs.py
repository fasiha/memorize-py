def schedule(timeToRecallProb: Callable[[float], float], q: float, T: float, rng=None):
  """Suggest a due date for flashcard given its time-varying probability of recall
  
  Inputs:
  - `timeToRecallProb` function that returns recall probability at any given time
  - `q` tunable parameter balancing forgetting versus high review rates
  - `T` maximum time horizon (may be `math.inf`)
  - `rng` an instance of `random.Random`, or `None` for default random number generator

  Returns a time in the future to schedule this item *or* `inf` if the item should not be
  scheduled within `T` time units.

  Note that "time" here means "units from now", and "now" means 0. The average value
  returned by this function will be `>= sqrt(q)` (though of course the minimum value is 0
  and the maximum finite value is `T`).

  Implements the Memorize algorithm from "Enhancing human learning via spaced
  repetition optimization" by Behzad Tabibian, Utkarsh Upadhyay, Abir De, Ali
  Zarezade, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf, and Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez in PNAS, 2019.
